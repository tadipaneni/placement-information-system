Answer & Explanations

 <br>

1. Exp.  S.P 1- C.P  =  C.P – S.P 2
<br>
    56 -  C.P =  C.P -  42
<br>
    2 C.P =  56 + 42;
<br>
    C.P =    98/2  = 49
<br><br>
2. Exp.  Let  C.P  of  each  article  be  Rs.  1.
<br>
    Then  C.P  of  18  articles  =   Rs.  18, 
<br>
    S.P  of  18  articles  =   Rs.  21.
<br>
    Gain %  =  ( 3/18 * 100 ) %  =  16 2/3
<br><br>
3. Exp.  Let  the  original  S.P be  Rs. X.  Then  new  S.P  =  Rs.  2/3 X,  Loss  =10%
<br>
    So  C.P   = Rs. [100/90*2/3 X  ] =  20 X/27.
<br>
    Now  C.P  =  Rs.  20X/27,  S.P  =Rs. X,  Gain  =  Rs. [ X  -20X/27 ]  =Rs.7X/27.
<br>
    Gain  %  = [ 7X/27 *27/20X *100 ]%   =35%
<br><br>
4. Exp.Let the C.P of  the horse  be  Rs. X, Then,  C.P  of  the  carriage = Rs.(3000- x).
<br>
    20%  of   x  -  10%  of  (  3000-x  )  =2%  of  3000  =  60,
<br>
    x/5  -   (  3000-x  )/10  =  60,   3x  - 3000  =  600,  3x  =3600,  x  =  1200.
<br>
    Hence,  C.P  of  the  horse  =  Rs. 1200
<br><br>
5. Exp.  Let  the  original  price  of  the  jewel  be  Rs. P  and  let  the  profit  earned  by  the  third  seller 
    be  x%.
<br>
    Then,  ( 100 +x )%  of  125%  of  120%  of  P  =  165%  of  p
<br>
     [ ( 100+x )/100*125/100*120/100* P ]  =  [ 165/100* P ]
<br>
     (  100 + X  )  =     165*100*100    =  110,     X  =  10%.
v
                                   125*120
<br><br>
6.  Exp.  Let   C.P  =  Rs. 100,   Then   S.P  =  Rs.133.
<br>
     Let  the  marked  price  be   x
<br>
     Then ,  95%  of  x  =   133,   95 x/ 100  =133,  x  = 133*100/95  =140
<br>
     Marked   price  =  40%  above   C.P
<br><br>
7. Exp.  C.P  OF  200 kg  of  mix  =  Rs.[ 80*13.50+120*16 ] =Rs.3000
<br>
    S.P =116%  of  Rs.3000  = Rs.      116/100*3000   =  3480   
<br>
    Rate  of  S .P   of  the  mixture   =  Rs. [ 3480/200]  per  kg 
<br>
                                                  =  Rs.  17.40  per  kg
<br><br>
8. Exp.   110/100*115/100*125/100*C.P   =1265,  11/10*23/20*5/4 C.P  =1265
<br>
    C.P  =   800
<br><br>
9. Exp.  Gain %  =              Error      *100      %
<br>
                      (  True value) - Error

 <br>

                       =     1000gm  -900gm * 100   %   =  100/900*100%  =  100/9
<br>
                                         1000 -100     
<br>
                       =   11 1/9 %
<br><br>
10. Exp.  Alligation   Method
      
 
<br>
         Ratio  of  quantities  sold  at  14%  profit  and  6%  loss  =   1:  9
<br>
         Quantity  sold  at  14%  profit    =  50/1+9  *1  =  5 kg
<br>
         Quantity  sold  at  6%  loss         =  50/1+9   *9 =  45kg
 <br>
